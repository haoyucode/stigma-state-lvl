    "Statistical weights for the study eligible respondents were calculated using __panel base sampling weights__ to start. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Panel base sampling weights** for all sampled housing units are computed as the inverse of probability of selection \n",
    "from the NORC National Frame (the sampling frame that is used to sample housing units for AmeriSpeak) \n",
    "or address-based sample. The sample design and recruitment protocol for the AmeriSpeak Panel involves \n",
    "subsampling of initial non-respondent housing units. These subsampled non-respondent housing units are \n",
    "selected for an in-person follow-up. The subsample of housing units that are selected for the nonresponse \n",
    "follow-up (NRFU) have their panel base sampling weights inflated by the inverse of the subsampling rate. \n",
    "The base sampling weights are further adjusted to account for unknown eligibility and nonresponse among \n",
    "eligible housing units. The household-level nonresponse adjusted weights are then post-stratified to external \n",
    "counts for number of households obtained from the Current Population Survey. Then, these household-level \n",
    "post-stratified weights are assigned to each eligible adult in every recruited household. Furthermore, a \n",
    "person-level nonresponse adjustment accounts for nonresponding adults within a recruited household. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, panel weights are raked to external population totals associated with age, sex, education, \n",
    "race/Hispanic ethnicity, housing tenure, telephone status, and Census Division. The external population \n",
    "totals are obtained from the Current Population Survey. The weights adjusted to the external population \n",
