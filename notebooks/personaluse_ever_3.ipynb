    "From a study by Taylor et al., a repeated cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of approximately 1000 persons, repeated every few months over the course of several years starting in Feb 2020. Survey questions ask about respondent demographics, personal and familial experience of illicit opioid use, personal and familial experience of contact with the criminal justice system, as well as personal attitudes towards OUD, persons with OUD, and policies related to OUD. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Stigma towards persons with OUD is measured as the average of the respondent’s answers to 6 questions. Each question is measured on a 5-point Likert scale (strongly agree to strongly disagree); the first four items are reverse-coded, so that higher scores indicate higher stigma. A score of 3 on any of these questions corresponds to an answer of ‘Do not agree or disagree’.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Items include:\n",
    "1. I would be willing to have a person with a past history of opioid use disorder/addiction start working closely with me on a job. \n",
    "2. I am comfortable having a person with a past history of opioid use disorder/addiction marry into my family.\n",
    "3. I would be willing to have a person with a current opioid use disorder/addiction start working closely with me on a job. \n",
    "4. I would be comfortable to have a person with a current opioid use disorder/addiction marry into my family.\n",
    "5. People with a current addiction to opioids/prescription pain medications are more dangerous than the general population.\n",
