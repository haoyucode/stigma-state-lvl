==============================

State level analyses of opioid use disorder (OUD) using the JCOIN 
MAARC Stigma Survey Protocol 2 ("in-depth")

Project Organization
------------

NOTE: only included what makes sense for now. below is the default cookiecutter data science structure.
TODO: modify this to given directory (e.g., changed some of the src package names, changed docs to markdown from rst (given comfortability using mkdocs -- may not need this but put here just in case))

Old Readme
------
# stigma-state-lvl
state level oud stigma estimate collaboration work with b. taylor and p. lamuda

# Usage

Get all packages used and dependencies:
`pip install -f requirements.txt`

# notebooks

`personaluse_ever_protocol2<latestn>.ipynb` contains the latest analysis.

Functions for this notebook have been refactored to `utils.py`


`strata-and-clusters-exploration`
contains exploration to identify the proper 
groups with the goal of understanding how to 
make correct bootstrap weights
